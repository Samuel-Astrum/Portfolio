**BASICS**
This is a game similar to DDR. Hold the correct arrow key once the arrows reach the proper space. After 5 points are gained, shoot a shot at the skeleton. Missing an arrow loses a player life, losing all lives loses the game. Shooting the skeleton makes the skeleton lose a life, if he loses all lives than you win.

**controls**
LEFT
RIGHT
UP
DOWN

hit associated arrow key on arrow when in correct position to score a point

A - shoot magic shot once you have enough points

START - pauses the game / starts the game / brings game back to start once win or lose

**BUGS**
the text that exists within the code is overwritten by the color of the background, i could get it to show if flip page, but it would cause immediate flipping between the screen.
when win/lose and go back to start, make sure to pause/unpause right at game start to show the correct screen :)
