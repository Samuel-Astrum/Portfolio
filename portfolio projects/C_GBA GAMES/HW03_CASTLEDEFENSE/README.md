**THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THIS GAME**

Upon entering the game, you will be on the start screen. Press start to start the game.

The black square is the player. Your goal is to protect the castle walls from the red enemies. With each wave they will vary in speed.
Each wave is cleared if one enemy is killed by the player or an enemy reaches the walls. The walls have 3 hits before they are gone.
Then, if an enemy hits the golden crown area, you lose.

To win the game, kill 25 "waves" of monsters.

At random, after killing a wave of monsters a yellow powerup will appear. Picking this power up up and taking it to the brown chest and pressing
 "A" will grant the player a speed boost, so they can better slay the monsters.
