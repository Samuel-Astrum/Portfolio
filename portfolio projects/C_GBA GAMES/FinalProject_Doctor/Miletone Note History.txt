    SO FAR, WHAT I HAVE FINISHED IN THE GAME IS THE GENERAL STATE PROGRESSION, THAT BEING FROM START, TO INSTRUCTIONS AND A LORE PAGE, TO AN 
    OVERWORLD MAP, THEN TO A ARMORY/WEAPON SELECTION ROOM, AND THEN TO THE BOSS BATTLE. WITHIN THE FINAL GAME, THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL BOSS BATTLE
    STATES FOR THE NEW BOSSES, AND THERE WILL BE NEW AREAS ON A LARGER PANNING MAP.
    I ALSO HAVE THE BASIC LOGIC FOR THE PLAYER, THAT BEING GENERAL MOVEMENT IN THE MAP MODE, AS WELL AS MOVEMENT IN THE BOSS ROOM. I DO NOT HAVE
    A SPRITE TO SHOW, BUT I ALSO HAVE ATTACKING AND A COOLDOWN, AS SHOWN WITHIN THE MGBA LOG.

    THE SPRITES AND BACKGROUNDS STILL NEED TO BE ADDED OF COURSE, AS WELL AS PAUSE. THE BOSSES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS NEED TO BE ADDED. 
    TWO SEPERATE WEAPON ARCHETYPES FOR THE PLAYER NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

    ONE BUG THAT HAS PUZZLED ME IS THE INITIALIZATION OF THE FIRST BOSS. FOR THIS MILESTONE, THE BOSS SHOULD APPEAR, AND ATTACK AT REGULAR INTERVALS.
    I HAVE CODE IN THE BOSS.C TO UPDATE THE BOSS ATTACKING, AS WELL AS INITIALIZATION AND LIVES. WHEN I LOGGED THE X AND Y COORDS OF THE BOSS, THEY
    WERE HUGELY SMALL NUMBERS, LIKE -867526 AND 867526. I ALSO HAVE LOGS FOR THE ENEMY ATTACK, ALTHOUGH DUE TO THE INITIALIZATION BUG IT DOES NOT
    SHOW.

    HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
    ON THE START SCREEN, PRESS START TO MOVE TO LORE OR PRESS SELECT TO GO TO CONTROLS
    IN CONTROLS, PRESS START TO GO BACK TO START
    IN LORE, PRESS START TO GO TO THE OVERWORLD MAP
    ON THE MAP, YOU CAN MOVE THE PLAYER WITH THE ARROW KEYS. MOVE TO THE GREEN BOX AND PRESS A.
    NOW YOU ARE IN THE ARMORY. NORMALLY YOU WOULD SELECT YOUR WEAPON, BUT NOT AT THE MOMENT. USE THE ARROWS TO WALK TO THE DOOR ON THE RIGHT AND 
        PRESS A AT THE DOOR
    NOW YOU ARE IN THE FIRST BOSS ROOM, BUT DUE TO WHAT I STATED PRIOR, HES CURRENTLY TAKING A LITTLE NAP AT THE MOMENT! TO ATTACK, PRESS A.
    IF YOU CHECK THE MGBA LOGS, YOU CAN SEE YOUR ATTACK, AS WELL AS IF IT HIT (DOUBTFUL), AND YOUR PRIOR STATES SO FAR
    ONCE YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH FUN THERE I'VE ADDED A LITTLE DEV CHEAT FOR NOW, PRESSING START WILL MOVE YOU TO THE WIN STATE
    THIS STATE IS CURRENTLY JUST USING OVERFLOW PALETTE SPACE, SO IT LOOKS WEIRD, BUT YOU CAN SEE THE STATE IN THE LOG.
    TO SHOW THE CYCLING STATES, PRESSING START WILL BRING YOU TO THE LOSE SCREEN, SAME AS WIN, IT IS USING OVERFLOW, BUT CAN BE CHECKED IN LOG
    PRESSING START HERE WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE START MENU.
    AS THE FUTURE BOSSES HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED, I DID NOT INCLUDE THE LATER BOSS2 AND DUNGEON2 STATES.
