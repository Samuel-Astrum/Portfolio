WELCOME TO MY AMAZING FROGGER GAME!!

Upon launch, you will see a yellow screen with a smiley face! This is the START SCREEN.

To begin the game, simply press START.

Upon entering the game, your green square, known as the FROG, will be found at the bottom of the screen.

The objective of the game is to make it to the green zone at the top of the screen. Hitting a Car, falling into water, and riding a log off the map will reset the FROG's position, and you will lose a life.

You have 3 lives before you go to the LOSE screen.
Getting to the green zone will result in the WIN screen.

UP : move FROG up
DOWN : move FROG down
LEFT : move FROG left
RIGHT : move FROG right
