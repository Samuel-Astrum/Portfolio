**GAMEPLAY**

You are Bub the Dragon, and your goal is to get all the monsters into bubbles, hit them, turn them into fruit, and collect the fruit. There are two types of enemies. The first enemy moves similar to you, and can jump. The other enemy will make a beeline towards you, so be careful!


**CONTROLS**
A : BLOW BUBBLE
B: JUMP
LEFT: MOVE LEFT
RIGHT: MOVE RIGHT
START: PAUSE, RESET, START

**KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES TO HELP PLAYTESTER**

--The sprite sheet was updated towards the end, and unfortunatly the yellow enemy tile indexes are not fully aligned, so they get cut off.

--the game is HEAVILY imbalanced, so if you dont immediately moved the enemies will move towards you, trap you in your spawn point, and kill you.

--my best advice for the above is to immediately move right and fall through the hole in the floor.

--the fruit immediately appears after the bubble is popped at the site of the bubble, so Bub immediately picks it up, its hard to see but the Apple does appear.

--Score and health are gathered within the code, however I ran into issues displaying it on the screen. I took a really hard way of encoding it into sprites which was bad and a headache and painful and.....

--PAUSE acts as a reset for the game.

-- after the game is complete, sprite hiding is a bit buggy 

-- fruit sprite sometimes does not disappear after Bub collects
